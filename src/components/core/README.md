#core/ (Core/Atomic Modules)
These are the most basic, presentation-only building blocks. They are highly reusable, shouldn't contain application-specific business logic, and are often referred to as Presentational or Atomic components.

Role: Defines the fundamental look and feel (design system).

Examples: Button.vue, Icon.vue, Input.vue, Badge.vue.
